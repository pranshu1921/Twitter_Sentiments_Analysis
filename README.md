# Twitter_Sentiments_Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook to discover and visualize topics from a corpus of Twitter tweets.

Calculated tf-idf matrix for non-negative matrix factorization, filtering stop words and getting words' frequency in the corpus.
Visualised top words using 'wordcloud' package in Python.

## General info
Sentiment analysis is commonly used in marketing and customer service to answer questions such as "Is a product review positive or negative?" and "How are customers responding to a product release?"

Topic modeling discovers the abstract topics in a corpus of texts. The results from topic modeling analysis can then be used in sentiment analysis. For example, they can be used to split texts into different subsets and allow us to train a separate sentiment model for each of the subsets. Training separate sentiment models for different subsets can lead to more accurate predictions than using a single model for all the texts.

This notebook illustrates how to discover and visualize topics from a corpus of Twitter tweets using Jupyter notebook.
